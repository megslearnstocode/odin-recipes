    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>It’s never too late to have a happy childhood, and if that alternative childhood you’re working on includes eating comfort foods cooked by an Italian Nonna, then this chicken pastina needs to be a part of it. I like to describe this simple soup as a warm hug on a spoon.</p>
    <p> The recipe will work with any meat or vegetable stock, so once you get the method down, things like leftover turkey from a holiday meal pastina can become part of your comfort food repertoire. No matter what you decide to use, or what mood you’re in when you make it, I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups prepared chicken broth</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup stelline (star-shaped) pastina, or other pastina such as acini di pepe</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (1 1/2 ounces by weight)</li>
        <li>extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring broth to a simmer over medium-high heat. Taste; season with salt if needed. </li>
