    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart rectangular baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta and place in prepared baking dish; cover to keep warm.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, onion, and celery; cook and stir until tender, about 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir garlic, Italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper into the skillet; cook until fragrant, 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Add wine, if using, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from bottom of skillet; cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in turkey, condensed soup, sour cream, and chicken broth; cook until sauce is heated through and bubbles, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Spoon turkey mixture over pasta; sprinkle Parmesan cheese and almonds on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 25 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy! After all that work, you deserve a good meal.</li>
